INFORMATICA
Informatica PC-extracts data from all the systems and store it into a single table.

Source-from which the new changes are coming
Target-to which you are moving the new changes

To Load Data to the Db using shortcuts:

Login to PC
1.Import the structure of Source.-go to Source Analyzer, -sources,import from file, control S.
2.Import the structure of Target.-go to Target Designer,-from folder Sources drag and drop Source into the Target Designer,double click,data type, columns,-control S.

3.-go to targets on the top,-generate and execute SQL,
-go to SQL developer to check the table is present in db.

4.Create Mapping.-go to Mapping Designer,-mappings on the top,create(m_FF_ORA_table_name),-drag and drop Source and Target,arrange all if mapping is messed(Mapping should be valid),-control S.

5.-Go to Mappings,generate Workflow, go to workflows, refresh by logout,login, it’s created,-check /fail parent if task fails(if no choice, session will fail, workflow will succeed),/stop an error:always 1(from first error it will stop),/reading data from the right folder,/truncate target table option(you don’t need to load data again and again),-control S.

6.Start Workflow.

If you want:
-to make changes, Take a BACK UP(mappings,copy as m_FF_ORA_table_name_bkp)(if messed up, control C and Control V)

-to see which mapping the folder uses(right click-> dependencies->right click->open in workspace)

-to find tables,fields(control F or search button)

-Green ckeck marks means Checked out(Only I have access),Check In-when work is done (versioning on the top->find ckechouts->all folders).

-to see who is connected to your pc(right click->versioning->view history)

-to delete Mapping(hit delete->control S(commit)

-to bring everything back(right click->versioning>undo checkout

-to create mapping with the same name of deleting name(versioning on the top->find ckeckouts->ckeck in)

When you have Constraint in your target table, target load type:Normal, if Bulk-fail

Normal.                                     Bulk
(if your source have                  (it will pick up 
hundreds records it will             hundreds records     
pick up 1 record and                and load hundreds
load 1 record).                      records)

To keep Bulk:

PRE SQL-disable                     POST SQL-enable
(whatever you type will happen (whatever you type will
before the data is loaded)     happen after the data
                               is loaded)
                               (update,delete,create)
How do you use Bulk mode when target has constraints?
1)alter table table_name disable/enable constraint constraint_name(sys);
2)if hundreds constraints: create reusable stored procedure to disable constraint in pre sql and enable constraint in post sql.

Call hr.disable_enable_constarints(‘schema_name’,
’table_name’,’disable/enable’-action.


To add constraint:
Alter table table_name
Add unique(deptid)

Convert: Abdul—->abdul
Go to POST sql and type:
update hr.table_name set name=‘abdul’
where empid=1;
Commit

Create another table with the same structure as previous table:

create table table_name_1
as
select* from table_name
where 1=2;

To load data from previous table to new table:
Go to session, edit tasks,mapping,target table name:table_name_1
Table name Prefix:HR (the properties of the session level will override the properties of the mapping level)
