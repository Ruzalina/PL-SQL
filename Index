Index
What are the different types of Index?
Indexes in SQL are used to speed up SQL queries. 
Types of indexes:
bitmap= for columns that has duplicates (not default, have to mention 'bitmap' in the syntax (good ex. is gender column)).

b-tree= for columns that doesn't have duplicates (default),they are best for high cardinality.

Create index index_name_idx
on table name(column_names);
