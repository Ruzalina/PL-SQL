SQL interview questions
1. What is the difference between where and having in SQL.

Where is used to filter out data, Having is used to filter out data when we have aggregate functions in select statement(count,min,max,sum,avg).

In the clause 'group by’,we have to use both 'where' and 'having' in the same querry, in this case 'where' has to be before the clause 'group by’.
